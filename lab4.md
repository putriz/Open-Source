####LAB 4
We choose FreeBSD and the errors we fixed are:
In the Handbook, we fixed the words 'on screen' to 'on-screen' in 5.2 Terminology, a run-on sentence in chapter 14,
and 'chrooted'  to 'chroot-ed' in the same chapter. 

Documentation is important because people who want to use the code can easily understand it without having
to learn everything by themselves.

What I learned from this lab is that there are a lot of documents for documentation that are liable to mistakes. 
Many people can contribute to fixing errors easily rather than just one of two people so that the documentation is better.
