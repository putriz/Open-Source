##The Open Source Definition Reading Reflection
###It's great to know that the definiton for Open Source is much more than just an access to the source code. It's particularly interesting to me to see criterias like "No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups" and "License Must be Technology-Neutral". To me that shows that the Open Source Initiative is open for everyone and anyone and is really is a collaborative commitement that allows a lot of creative freedom.
